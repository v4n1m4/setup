# Basic privacy & security tightening on system preferences, by category on OS 14.5 (Sonoma)
Very basic system preference tweaks that might help keep you to be a little more secure/private than a normal user. 

### Wi-Fi
- Your Network > Details > Limit IP Address Tracking (On, usually default)
- Optionally adding proxies can increase privacy, those settings are under your network details too.

### Network
- Firewall: Block all incoming connnections (Yes, which subsequently disables any automatic incoming connections from in-built software & signed software, and also enables stealth mode).

### Screen time
- Disabled (Personal preference)

### General
- Software Update: Automatic updates on
- Airdrop & Handoff: All of these disabled (no personal need for them, seems better off than on).
- Login items: Check that you're okay with anything enabled to start at login and permitted to run in the background.
- Sharing: I've disabled all settings here. I'd especiallly ensure remote 

### Accessibility
- Voice Control: Off

### Siri & Spotlight
- Ask Siri: Off
- Spotlight: Some research says it's best to turn spotlight off completely, however I've just disabled siri suggestions & websites.

### Privacy & Security 
- Location: Off (All)
- Category: Monitor each category as you install new apps/over time to ensure nothing has a permission you'd prefer not to grant.
- Filevault: On
- Lockdown Mode: Off (Tempted to see if you can have an operational system with this on, I doubt it though).
- All accessories to connect: Ask every time
- Analytics & Improvements: All off.
- Advanced > Require administrator password to change system-wide settings - Yes, after you're satisfied with the state of all system preferences.

There's not a lot to adjust after Privacy & Security. I've disabled Game Center, and will use other software for things like account & password management. Wallet & Apple pay won't be enabled either.
